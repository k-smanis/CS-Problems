This repo is divided into several standalone topic-folders, each one revolving around a concept of CS problems (like graphs, evolutionary algorithms, etc.)
Each of the standalone topic-folders contains a collection of python scripts, where each script addresses a particular problem.
You should be able to run each of the scripts to solve the corresponding problem.
